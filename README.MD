- Building active individuals that have advanced public speaking skills, advanced researching and self learning skills, and advanced writing skills, especially when writing about projects or technical concepts.
- Advancing in basic programming concepts, OOP for example, and essential methodologies such as Clean Code.
- Advancing in basic and intermediate flutter concepts that are essential for building full simple and intermediate mobile apps.
- Introduction to some advanced software development concepts such as Clean Architecture and Design patterns.
- Building projects portfolio from different projects starting from the advanced level, some of the projects will be as individuals and others will be in teams.
