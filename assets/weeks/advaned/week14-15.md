# Week 14-15: Practical Break: E-Commerce App.

During this project, we will work individually, design, and implement an E-Commerce system. We will use the [Asos-Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/asos2/) to retrieve the categories, and products, create and retrieve users, and manage cart items. The API doesn’t provide managing an order, but it has the shopping cart part, where we can add products to the Shopping cart that belongs to the user.
