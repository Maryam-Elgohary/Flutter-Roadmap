# Second Project (Groups)

During this project, we will work in groups to plan, design, and implement an E-Commerce system. We will use the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to retrieve the categories, products, create and retrieve users, and manage cart items. The API doesnâ€™t provide managing an order, but it has the shopping cart part, where we can add products to shopping cart that belongs to the user.

Each group must go through the following process:

- Creating the System **UML** to define system classes and processes.
- Choosing an appropriate UI design to follow as a general theme.
- Coding the project in Flutter

To choose an appropriate UI design, you can search on such as:
