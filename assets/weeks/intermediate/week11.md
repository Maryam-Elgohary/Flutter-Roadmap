# Week 11: SQLite (2)

In this week, we will continue working on SQLite in Flutter. But before going into how to use SQLite in Flutter, we must know first **What is SQLite?** For this part, please read this [article](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/sql-tutorial/what-is-sqlite) and search on google for more details.

After reading the article, please read how to use the sqflite package from [the official Flutter packages website](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) and you can, for sure, find more examples on Google or YouTube.

Now, let’s have some fun!

**Important Note:** All the tasks for this week will be similar to the previous week, so please start as early as you can and give all the time you can for the task. Also, if you need any help don’t hesitate to ask on our discord channels, contact the committee head or the official IEEE ManCSC Facebook page.
